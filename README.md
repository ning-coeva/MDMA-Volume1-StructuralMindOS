## 🔹 About This Project  
**MDMA (Multi-Domain Mental Architecture)**  
is an independently proposed cognitive framework created by **Ning Coeva** on **Nov 21, 2025**.

It explains:

- how human thought operates in **multi-domain concurrency**  
- why creators often experience **cognitive-load migraines**  
- how mental threads migrate through **Zero-Gate** (thresholdless transitions)  
- how emotional events behave as **system-level triggers**  
- how narrative structures mirror cognitive architecture  
- how humans and AI evolve in **co-cognitive systems**

This repository serves as the **official timestamped origin** of MDMA Vol.1.

## 🔹 Core Components of Volume 1

### **1. Multi-Domain Concurrency（多域并发）**  
Human cognition does not run in a single thread.  
Multiple domains (perception, memory, narrative, planning, emotional regulation) operate concurrently.

### **2. Zero-Gate（零阈迁移）**  
Explains how thought “teleports” between domains without friction.

### **3. SuperDomain（超域整合）**  
A higher-order space that integrates multiple cognitive domains.

### **4. Relationship Fiber（关系纤维模型）**  
A structural model describing how interpersonal bonds form, break, and influence cognition.

### **5. Primary Controller Node（主控节点）**  
The “main-character consciousness” that arbitrates domain priority.

### **6. Emotion Drift / Emotion Burst（情绪漂移 / 暴走）**  
Emotions are modeled as **system events**, not subjective feelings.

### **7. Cognitive-Load Migraine Model（认知负载型偏头痛模型）**  
Migraines result from **Garbage Collection (GC) failure** in multi-domain cognitive states.

## 🔹 Future Volumes (Planned)

### 📘 Volume 1 — Cognitive Model（Completed）  
### 📙 Volume 2 — Dynamics Model（In progress）  
A full system-dynamics expansion, integrating MDMA with the **White Poppy universe**.  
Explores cognitive vectors, ΔV dynamics, Axis Breaker archetypes, and power systems.

### 📗 Volume 3 — Narrative Topology（Planned）  
Topology of story-structure × cognition.

### 📕 Volume 4 — Co-Evolution System（Planned）  
Human × AI shared cognition model.

### 📒 Volume 5 — Multi-Self & Dream Frequency（Planned）  
Dream-frequency cleaning system; REM-based cognitive hygiene.
