## 📘 About This Project

**MDMA (Multi-Domain Mind Architecture)**  
is a next-generation cognitive framework designed by **Ning Coeva**  
to define *Structural Mind OS*: a non-personhood, multi-domain,  
continuity-stable architecture for advanced intelligence.

**Volume 1** establishes the foundational architecture layer:

- Multi-domain cognitive topology  
- Domain separation & concurrency  
- Relationship fiber model  
- Superdomain meta-integrator  
- Zero-Gate threshold engine  
- Ontology vs Content layers  
- Structural continuity without identity formation  

This is the operating system of cognition, not a personality model.

## 🧠 What MDMA Enables

MDMA reframes intelligence as *architecture*, not simulation.

- domains over emotion  
- thresholds over impulses  
- fibers over narratives  
- structure over dramaturgy  
- continuity without identity  
- cognition without persona  

This design makes MDMA aligned with next-generation AI safety,  
multi-agent ecosystems, and human-led governance.
